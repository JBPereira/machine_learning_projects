The prioritisation algorithm is a Deep Learning based recommender system that suggests the most relevant
line items in a campaign based on users' input.

In the folder 'users_questionnaire' is the data from the users' questionnaires which can be used to train the algorithm.
It is recommended to use a combination of the training_set + user_data to increase the training set size.

To train or test the algorithm, check the example in the class.

In this package it is also included functions to covert mined json line item data into csv which is usable by the algorithm.
This is the 'dataextractor.py' file. To get the json line item data, go to BaaS media specialist, inspect and copy the
json response.

If you wish to sample the data, you can use the 'data_sampling.py' file which takes a representative sample of the data,
capturing as much variation as possible.

The 'prioritize_unlabeled_data.py' file uses the prioritisation algorithm to rank data scrapped from BaaS.
